## Improved Project Head Data Syncing from Notion

This update enhances the synchronization of project head information (such as Sales Person, Tech Lead, and Account Managers) from Notion. Previously, some roles were synced using names, while others used emails. To improve accuracy and consistency, all relevant project head roles will now be synced using their email addresses when available in Notion.

This change primarily affects the internal data representation and syncing process, leading to more reliable project head information within the system.
