## ⚡ Performance Recommendations

### For Production Deployment

1. **Optimal Configuration**
   ```go
   PrometheusConfig{
       Enabled:        true,
       SampleRate:     1.0,    // Monitor all requests initially
       NormalizePaths: true,   // Prevent cardinality explosion
       MaxEndpoints:   200,    // Limit unique endpoints
   }
   ```

2. **Monitoring Strategy**
   - Start with 100% sampling rate
   - Monitor actual overhead in production
   - Adjust sample rate if needed (0.8-0.9 for high traffic)
   - Use path exclusion for high-frequency, low-value endpoints

### Performance Tuning Recommendations

1. **High-Traffic Environments**
   - Consider reducing sample rate to 0.8-0.9
   - Exclude health check and static asset endpoints
   - Monitor metric cardinality to prevent explosion

2. **Database-Intensive Applications**
   - Monitor slow query threshold effectiveness
   - Adjust business domain mappings for efficiency
   - Consider selective metric collection for high-frequency operations

3. **Security-Sensitive Environments**
   - Maintain full security monitoring (minimal overhead)
   - Tune threat detection sensitivity
   - Monitor authentication pattern cache efficiency
