- **End-to-End Workflow**: Complete security monitoring pipeline testing

## Performance Benchmarking Results

### Baseline Performance
- **Without Security Monitoring**: 1,353 ns/op (baseline)
- **Security Monitoring Disabled**: 1,369 ns/op (1.2% overhead)
- **Security Monitoring Enabled**: 2,279 ns/op (68.4% overhead)

### Analysis
- **Disabled overhead: 1.2%** - within acceptable limits for production
- **Enabled overhead: 68.4%** - comprehensive monitoring with full threat detection
- **Optional feature** - can be disabled in production environments if needed
- **Real-world applications** typically have much higher processing overhead than test endpoints

### Benchmark Categories
- **Authentication with Security**: 6,431 ns/op (includes JWT validation)
- **Authentication Failures**: 3,259 ns/op (includes threat detection)
- **Threat Detection**: 2,163 ns/op (pattern analysis)
- **Permission Monitoring**: 1,981 ns/op (authorization tracking)
- **Concurrent Processing**: 1,972 ns/op (multi-threaded safety)

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication Monitoring
- **Method detection**: JWT Bearer tokens, API keys, unknown methods
- **Success/failure tracking** with detailed reason categorization
- **Duration monitoring** by authentication method
- **API key client tracking** with usage patterns

### 2. Authorization Monitoring
- **Permission check tracking** with allow/deny results
- **Authorization duration monitoring** by permission type
- **Security event logging** for permission violations
- **Context-aware logging** with client IP and user agent

### 3. Threat Detection
- **Brute force detection** with configurable thresholds and time windows
- **Suspicious pattern analysis**:
  - Rapid request detection (potential bot activity)
  - User agent variation detection (potential spoofing)
- **Real-time threat classification** with severity levels
- **Automatic data cleanup** to prevent memory leaks

### 4. Security Event Logging
- **Structured logging** with security context fields
- **Configurable verbosity** for production environments
- **Security audit trail** for compliance requirements
- **Integration ready** for SIEM systems

## Configuration Options

### Security Monitoring Configuration
```go
type SecurityMonitoringConfig struct {
    Enabled                   bool          // Master enable/disable
    ThreatDetectionEnabled    bool          // Threat detection features
    BruteForceThreshold       int           // Failed attempts threshold
    BruteForceWindow          time.Duration // Time window for brute force detection
    SuspiciousPatternEnabled  bool          // Pattern analysis features
    LogSecurityEvents         bool          // Security event logging
    RateLimitMonitoring       bool          // Rate limit violation tracking
}
```

### Default Values
- **Enabled**: true
- **ThreatDetectionEnabled**: true
- **BruteForceThreshold**: 10 attempts
- **BruteForceWindow**: 5 minutes
- **SuspiciousPatternEnabled**: true
- **LogSecurityEvents**: true
