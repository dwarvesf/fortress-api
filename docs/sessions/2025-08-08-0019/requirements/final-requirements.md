# Final Monitoring Requirements

## Monitoring Objectives
- **All monitoring aspects**: Performance, operational health, business insights, and security
- **High-level monitoring**: Focus on key metrics without deep granularity

## Technical Environment
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus (metrics), Grafana (visualization), Loki (logs)
- **Preference**: Open-source solutions only

## System Context
- Go web API using Gin framework
- PostgreSQL database with GORM
- Layered architecture: Routes → Controllers → Services → Stores → Database
- JWT authentication with role-based permissions
- External integrations: Discord, SendGrid, GitHub API, Google Cloud services

## Success Criteria
- High-level observability across all system layers
- Integration with existing Prometheus/Grafana/Loki stack
- Minimal complexity implementation
- Coverage of performance, health, business, and security metrics
