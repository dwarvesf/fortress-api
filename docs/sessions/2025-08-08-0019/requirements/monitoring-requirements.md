# Monitoring Requirements

## Initial Request
**User Query**: "walkthrough the codebase and analyze how to monitor this system? which area, metrics to monitor?"

## System Context
Based on CLAUDE.md analysis, this is a Go web API with the following characteristics:
- **Framework**: Gin web framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with GORM
- **Architecture**: Layered architecture (Routes → Controllers → Services → Stores → Database)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role permissions
- **External Integrations**: Discord, SendGrid, GitHub API, Google Cloud services
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose for local development

## Monitoring Scope Questions

To provide a comprehensive monitoring strategy, I need clarification on:

### 1. Monitoring Objectives
- **Performance monitoring**: Are you primarily concerned with response times, throughput, resource utilization?
- **Business metrics**: Do you want to track user activities, API usage patterns, feature adoption?
- **Operational health**: Focus on system uptime, error rates, service availability?
- **Security monitoring**: Track authentication failures, suspicious activities, rate limiting?

### 2. Deployment Environment
- **Target environment**: Production, staging, or both?
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure), on-premises, or hybrid?
- **Container orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or simple Docker Compose?
- **Current monitoring tools**: Any existing monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, etc.)?

### 3. Monitoring Requirements
- **Real-time vs batch**: Need for real-time alerting or periodic reporting?
- **Retention period**: How long should metrics be stored?
- **Alerting preferences**: Email, Slack, PagerDuty, or other notification channels?
- **Compliance requirements**: Any regulatory requirements for monitoring/logging?

### 4. Implementation Constraints
- **Budget**: Preference for open-source vs commercial solutions?
- **Team expertise**: Current monitoring/observability experience in the team?
- **Integration complexity**: Preference for minimal changes vs comprehensive instrumentation?

## Preliminary Analysis Areas

Based on the codebase structure, key monitoring areas include:

### Application Layer
- HTTP request/response metrics (latency, status codes, throughput)
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Business logic performance (service layer execution times)
- Database query performance and connection pool health

### Infrastructure Layer
- System resources (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Database performance and connection health
- External service integration health (Discord, SendGrid, GitHub)

### Security Layer
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limiting violations
- Unusual access patterns

Please provide clarification on your monitoring priorities and constraints so I can tailor the analysis accordingly.
