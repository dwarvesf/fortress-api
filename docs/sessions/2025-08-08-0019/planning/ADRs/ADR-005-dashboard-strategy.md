# ADR-005: Dashboard Strategy and Visualization Framework

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-08-08  
**Deciders**: Planning Team

## Context

The Fortress API monitoring implementation needs comprehensive dashboards that serve different stakeholders:

- **Engineering Team**: Technical performance, system health, deployment impact  
- **Operations Team**: Service reliability, incident response, capacity planning
- **Business Stakeholders**: Feature usage, business KPIs, revenue-affecting issues
- **Executive Team**: High-level health, SLO compliance, business impact

Current state: Basic Swagger documentation UI, no operational dashboards, limited visibility into system performance or business metrics.

### Stakeholder Analysis
- **Backend Engineers**: Need detailed technical metrics, database performance, API endpoint analysis
- **DevOps/SRE**: Require infrastructure metrics, deployment tracking, alert context  
- **Product Managers**: Want feature adoption, user behavior, performance impact on UX
- **Finance Team**: Need invoice processing health, payroll system status, business transaction monitoring
- **Executive Team**: High-level KPIs, SLO compliance, incident impact summary

### Technical Constraints
- Existing Grafana deployment in Kubernetes cluster
- Team familiar with Grafana but needs structured approach
- Mixed technical expertise across stakeholders
- Need for both real-time and historical analysis

## Decision

We will implement a **multi-tier dashboard strategy** with role-based views and standardized visualization patterns:

### 2. Standardized Panel Design Patterns

#### RED Metrics (Requests, Errors, Duration) - Standard Layout
```yaml
Panel Set: "HTTP RED Metrics"
Layout: 3-column row

Panel 1 - Request Rate:
  Type: Stat with Graph
  Query: sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
  Thresholds:
    Green: >100 req/s (healthy traffic)
    Yellow: 50-100 req/s (moderate traffic)  
    Red: <50 req/s (low traffic alert)

Panel 2 - Error Rate:
  Type: Stat with Graph
  Query: sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
  Thresholds:
    Green: <1% (healthy)
    Yellow: 1-5% (degraded)
    Red: >5% (critical)

Panel 3 - Duration (95th percentile):
  Type: Stat with Graph  
  Query: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))
  Thresholds:
    Green: <200ms (excellent)
    Yellow: 200-500ms (acceptable)
    Red: >500ms (poor)
```

#### USE Metrics (Utilization, Saturation, Errors) - Infrastructure Focus
```yaml
Panel Set: "Infrastructure USE Metrics"
Layout: 4-column row

Panel 1 - CPU Utilization:
  Type: Gauge
  Query: rate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m]) * 100
  Thresholds: Green <50%, Yellow 50-80%, Red >80%

Panel 2 - Memory Utilization:
  Type: Gauge
  Query: go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes / go_memstats_heap_sys_bytes * 100
  Thresholds: Green <70%, Yellow 70-85%, Red >85%

Panel 3 - Database Connections:
  Type: Gauge
  Query: gorm_dbstats_in_use / gorm_dbstats_max_open_connections * 100
  Thresholds: Green <70%, Yellow 70-90%, Red >90%

Panel 4 - Goroutines:
  Type: Stat with Trend
  Query: go_goroutines
  Thresholds: Green <500, Yellow 500-1000, Red >1000
```

### 3. Business-Specific Dashboard Components

```

### 4. Advanced Visualization Patterns

#### Heatmap Visualizations
```yaml
Endpoint Performance Heatmap:
  X-Axis: Time (1-hour windows)
  Y-Axis: API Endpoints
  Color: 95th percentile latency
  Use Case: Identify performance patterns across time and endpoints

Error Rate Heatmap:
  X-Axis: Time (15-minute windows)  
  Y-Axis: HTTP Status Codes
  Color: Request count
  Use Case: Visual error pattern recognition
```

#### Correlation Dashboards  
```yaml
Performance Correlation Dashboard:
  Panel 1: Request Rate vs Latency (Scatter plot)
  Panel 2: Database Connections vs Response Time
  Panel 3: Memory Usage vs Garbage Collection
  Panel 4: Error Rate vs Deployment Events
  Use Case: Root cause analysis and performance optimization
```

#### SLO Tracking Dashboards
```yaml
SLO Compliance Dashboard:
  Panel: Error Budget Burndown
    - Shows remaining error budget over time
    - Burn rate visualization
    - Time to budget exhaustion
    
  Panel: SLO Trend Analysis
    - Historical SLO performance
    - Monthly/quarterly trends
    - Target vs actual performance
```

### 5. Interactive Features and Drill-Down

#### Template Variables
```yaml
Global Variables:
  - $environment: [production, staging, development]
  - $time_range: [5m, 15m, 1h, 6h, 1d, 7d]
  - $service: [fortress-api, fortress-discord, fortress-web]
  - $endpoint: [all, /api/v1/auth, /api/v1/employees, etc.]

Dynamic Filtering:
  - Filter by endpoint for detailed analysis
  - Time range selection for historical analysis
  - Environment switching for multi-env monitoring
```

#### Drill-Down Workflows
```yaml
Workflow 1: High-Level → Detailed Analysis
  Start: Executive Dashboard (High error rate observed)
  Drill: Operations Dashboard (Identify affected endpoints)  
  Deep: Technical Dashboard (Analyze specific endpoint performance)
  Action: Code-level investigation

Workflow 2: Alert → Root Cause
  Start: Alert notification with dashboard link
  Drill: Pre-filtered dashboard showing alert context
  Deep: Correlation analysis with related metrics
  Action: Targeted remediation
```

### 6. Mobile and Accessibility Considerations

#### Responsive Design Patterns
```yaml
Mobile Optimization:
  - Single-column layouts for small screens
  - Large, touch-friendly controls
  - Essential metrics only on mobile dashboards
  - Swipe navigation between dashboard sections

Accessibility:

  - Screen reader compatible annotations
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Alt text for visual elements
```

### 7. Dashboard Maintenance and Governance

#### Version Control and Change Management
```yaml
Dashboard as Code:
  - Store dashboard JSON in Git repository
