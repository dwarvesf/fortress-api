- 🎯 **SLO Achievement**: 99.9% availability target
- 🎯 **Business Continuity**: Zero payroll/invoice delays due to undetected issues

## Next Steps & Handoff

### 🚀 Ready for Implementation Phase

**Immediate Actions (Week 1)**:
1. **Development Team Assignment**: Assign backend engineers to SPEC-001, SPEC-002, SPEC-003
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure development environment with Prometheus stack
3. **Dependency Installation**: Add required Go modules for Prometheus client
4. **Branch Creation**: Create feature branch `feat/add0-monitoring` for implementation

**Implementation Priority Order**:
1. **SPEC-001** (HTTP Middleware) - Foundation for all other monitoring
2. **SPEC-002** (Database Monitoring) - Critical for performance visibility  
3. **SPEC-003** (Security Monitoring) - Essential for audit and compliance
4. **SPEC-004** (Business Metrics) - Value-add for stakeholder insights
5. **SPEC-005** (Kubernetes Deployment) - Production readiness

### 📋 Remaining Specifications

**SPEC-004: Business Metrics Integration** (Planned)
- Employee lifecycle monitoring (onboarding, performance, offboarding)
- Project management metrics (delivery, resource utilization)
- Client engagement tracking (communication, satisfaction)
- Financial process monitoring (commission calculations, expense tracking)

**SPEC-005: Kubernetes Deployment Configuration** (Planned)
- ServiceMonitor CRD configuration
- AlertManager routing rules
- Grafana dashboard provisioning
- Loki log aggregation setup

### 🔄 Quality Assurance Requirements

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests for all metrics collection logic
- Integration tests for end-to-end metric flow
- Performance tests to validate overhead targets
- Load tests to ensure stability under traffic

**Deployment Validation**:
- Staging environment validation
- Canary deployment (10% → 50% → 100%)
- Performance monitoring during rollout
- Rollback procedures tested
