# Phase 1 – Planning Status

- [x] Captured ADR-001 (ExpenseIntegration abstraction) and ADR-002 (cutover strategy).
- [x] Authored `specifications/expense_flow_spec.md` covering architecture, data model, API, config, and risks.
- [ ] Outstanding questions: finalize approver mapping source, confirm attachment storage decision during implementation kickoff (multi-attachment support now documented but needs implementation plan).

Status: COMPLETE
