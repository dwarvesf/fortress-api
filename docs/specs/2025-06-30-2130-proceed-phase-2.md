# Phase 2 MCP Workflow Implementation Session

**Started:** 2025-06-30 21:30  
**Type:** Phase 2 Development - Workflow-Level Operations

## Session Overview

Starting Phase 2 of the MCP Agentic Transformation, building on the completed Phase 1 foundation. Phase 1 successfully implemented all 16 core business tools (Employee, Project, Invoice, Payroll management). Phase 2 focuses on implementing workflow-level operations that orchestrate multiple business processes into cohesive, multi-step workflows.

### Current Foundation (From Phase 1)
- ✅ **MCP Server Infrastructure**: Fully operational with mark3labs/mcp-go v0.32.0
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Agent API keys, action logs, and workflow tracking tables
- ✅ **Authentication System**: API key validation, hashing, and permission management  
- ✅ **16 Core Tools**: Complete across all 4 business domains
- ✅ **Audit & Logging**: Comprehensive action logging with performance metrics

## Goals

### 1. **Primary Goal**: Implement Workflow Service Infrastructure
   - Create `pkg/service/workflow/` package for orchestrating multi-step operations
   - Design workflow state management and transaction handling
   - Implement workflow tracking using `agent_workflows` table
   - Add idempotency and rollback mechanisms

### 2. **Core Workflow Tools** (Phase 2.1 - Focused Scope):
   - `calculate_monthly_payroll` - Process entire monthly payroll cycle workflow
   - **ON HOLD**: `staff_new_project`, `process_project_completion`, `onboard_new_employee`  

### 3. **Quality Goals**:
   - Atomic multi-step operations with proper transaction management
   - Comprehensive error handling and rollback mechanisms
   - Performance monitoring for complex workflows
   - Maintain separation between workflow orchestration and existing business logic

### 4. **Advanced Features** (Phase 2.2 - if time permits):
   - Approval workflows for sensitive operations
   - Background job processing with status tracking
   - Real-time workflow status updates

## Technical Scope

### Workflow Service Architecture
```go
// pkg/service/workflow/workflow.go
type WorkflowService struct {
    db              *gorm.DB
    projectService  *project.Service
    employeeService *employee.Service
    invoiceService  *invoice.Service
    payrollService  *payroll.Service
    store           *store.Store
}

type WorkflowStatus string
const (
    WorkflowStatusPending    WorkflowStatus = "pending"
    WorkflowStatusInProgress WorkflowStatus = "in_progress" 
    WorkflowStatusCompleted  WorkflowStatus = "completed"
    WorkflowStatusFailed     WorkflowStatus = "failed"
    WorkflowStatusRolledBack WorkflowStatus = "rolled_back"
)
```

### Workflow Tools to Implement

**Priority Tool - Phase 2.1:**

1. **`calculate_monthly_payroll`** - Monthly Payroll Processing Workflow
   - Calculate base salaries for all active employees for specified month
   - Process project-based commissions and bonuses 
   - Handle salary advances and deductions from previous requests
   - Generate comprehensive payroll calculation sheet (dry-run mode by default)
   - **Optional**: Update cached payroll records and financial tracking (when dry_run=false)
   - **Removed**: Send payroll notifications (scope reduction)

**Deferred Tools (ON HOLD):**
- `staff_new_project` - Project Creation & Staffing Workflow
- `process_project_completion` - Project Closure Workflow  
- `onboard_new_employee` - Employee Onboarding Workflow

## Progress Log

### Update - 2025-06-30 22:45 PM

**Summary**: Fixed zero payroll values and implemented proper batch filtering

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: pkg/mcp/tools/workflow/tools.go, pkg/service/workflow/workflow.go, docs/specs/2025-06-30-2130-proceed-phase-2.md
- Current branch: feat/mcp-integration (commit: 4b687892)

**Todo Progress**: 1 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Filter employees by batch at database level instead of including them with zero values

**Issue Encountered**: Payroll calculations were returning 0 values for all employees despite real database integration

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Missing Preloading**: EmployeeFilter was missing `Preload: true`, so BaseSalary relationships weren't loaded
2. **Batch Filtering Logic**: Employees with mismatched batches were included with zero salaries instead of being filtered out

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Fixed Data Preloading**: Added `Preload: true` to EmployeeFilter to ensure BaseSalary and Currency relationships are loaded
2. **Enhanced Batch Debugging**: Added batch debugging fields to BaseSalaryInfo struct:
   - `employee_batch`: Employee's assigned batch (1 or 15)  
   - `requested_batch`: Requested payroll batch
   - `batch_matched`: Whether batches match
3. **Implemented Proper Batch Filtering**: Modified `getActiveEmployees()` to filter employees by batch before payroll calculation:
   - Only employees with `BaseSalary.Batch == params.Batch` are included
   - Employees without base salary are excluded entirely
   - Results in clean, relevant employee list instead of mixed zero/non-zero values

**Code Changes Made**:
- **pkg/mcp/tools/workflow/tools.go**: Added employee batch pre-filtering, enhanced debugging info
- **pkg/service/workflow/workflow.go**: Added batch debugging fields to BaseSalaryInfo struct
- **Build Status**: MCP server compiles successfully, ready for clean batch-filtered payroll testing

**Expected Results**: Payroll calculations now only include employees matching the requested batch, eliminating zero-value entries from batch mismatches

### Update - 2025-06-30 22:50 PM

### Update - 2025-07-01 05:20 AM

**Summary**: ✅ CRITICAL BUG FIX - Resolved empty payroll calculation results (0 employees instead of 27)

**Issue Diagnosed**:
- `get_available_employees` tool returned 27 employees correctly using database filtering
- `calculate_monthly_payroll` tool returned 0 employees due to faulty in-memory filtering
- Root cause: Model constant mismatch between `model.WorkingStatusFullTime` and database values

**Debug Analysis Completed**:
1. **Initial Hypothesis**: Soft-delete filtering issue (ruled out - no soft-deleted employees)
2. **Database Verification**: 250 total employees (27 full-time + 223 left), all active
3. **Code Analysis**: In-memory filtering `emp.WorkingStatus == model.WorkingStatusFullTime` failed
4. **Root Cause**: String comparison issue between model constant and database values

**Solution Implemented**:
- **File Modified**: `pkg/mcp/tools/workflow/tools.go:190-199`
- **Change**: Replaced in-memory filtering with database filtering approach
- **Before**: Empty `EmployeeFilter{}` + manual loop filtering
- **After**: `EmployeeFilter{WorkingStatuses: []string{"full-time"}}` (same as working tool)

**Code Changes**:
```go
// Fixed: Use database filtering instead of in-memory filtering
employees, _, err := t.store.Employee.All(t.repo.DB(), employee.EmployeeFilter{
    WorkingStatuses: []string{"full-time"},
}, model.Pagination{})
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Consistency**: Both tools now use identical filtering approach
- ✅ **Performance**: Database filtering more efficient than in-memory
- ✅ **Reliability**: Eliminates string encoding/formatting issues
- ✅ **Expected Result**: Should now return 27 employees instead of 0

**Verification**:
- ✅ MCP server builds successfully with fix applied
- ✅ Removed problematic in-memory filtering loop
- ✅ Aligned with working `list_available_employees` implementation
- 🔄 Ready for testing - should resolve empty payroll results

**Status**: Bug fix implemented and ready for production testing! 🎯

- Non-prod environments use live Wise API rates
- Production uses hardcoded fallback (25,000 VND/USD) for stability
- Check `t.cfg.Env != "prod"` for environment-specific logic

#### 3. **Service Integration Pattern**
```go
// Constructor pattern for service injection
func New(store *store.Store, repo store.DBRepo, wiseService wise.IService) *Service {
    return &Service{
        store:       store,
        repo:        repo,
        wiseService: wiseService,
    }
}
```

#### 4. **MCP Tool Registration**
- Always pass required services through constructor chain
- Maintain config parameter for environment-aware behavior
- Use `s.services.Wise` from main service container
