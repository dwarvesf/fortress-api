## Technical Context

### Completed Infrastructure
- MCP server using mark3labs/mcp-go v0.32.0
- Agent API key authentication system
- Action logging with performance metrics
- Database schemas for agent_api_keys, agent_action_logs, agent_workflows

### Implementation Pattern (from completed Employee tools)
```go
// Tool registration pattern in pkg/mcp/tools/employee/tools.go
func (t *EmployeeTools) GetEmployee(ctx context.Context, arguments map[string]interface{}) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {
    // 1. Extract and validate parameters
    // 2. Call existing service layer
    // 3. Log action with audit trail  
    // 4. Return MCP-formatted response
}
```

### Next Implementation Target
- **Location**: `pkg/mcp/tools/project/` (new package)
- **Dependencies**: Existing `pkg/service/project` and `pkg/store/project`
- **Pattern**: Follow employee tools structure and authentication wrapper
