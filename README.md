## Overview

This repository is the official BE service for Fortress

## How to contribute

### Prerequisites

1. Go installed
2. Docker installed

### How to run source code locally

1. Set up source

   Set up infras, install dependencies, etc.

   ```
   make init
   ```

2. Set up env

   Create a file `.env` with these values:

   ```
    DB_HOST="127.0.0.1"
    DB_PORT="25432"
    DB_USER="postgres"
    DB_PASS="postgres"
    DB_NAME="fortress_local"
    DB_SSL_MODE="disable"
    ALLOWED_ORIGINS="*"
    ENV=dev
    DEBUG=true
   ```

3. Run source

   ```
   make dev
   ```

   The service starts with port 8080 as the default

### How to work on a TODO

1. Feel free to pick any TODO for you from [Board View](https://www.notion.so/dwarves/4d756d46e90240918cd2505f962cacd1?v=d65335d1772f4532ab1bc274a1ae8c76)
2. **Assign** that item to your account

   - `Not Started`: not started yet
   - `Planned`: working on this sprint
   - `In Progress`: still working on
   - `In Review`: Task done = PR has been merged to `develop` branch at least
   - `Complete`: Confirmation from the team that the TODO is finished

- `migrations/`: contains seeds and SQL migration files
  - `schemas/`: contains DB schema migration files
  - `seed/`: contains seed files which will initialize DB with sets of dummy data
  - `test-seed/`: also seed files but for test DB
- `pkg/`: contains core source code of service
  - `config/`: contains configs for application
  - `handler/`: handling API requests
  - `logger/`: logging initial and functional methods
  - `model/`: DB model structs
  - `mw/`: middleware
  - `request/`: API request models
  - `routes/`: API routing (see [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin))

  - `store/`: data access layers, contains DB CRUD operations (see [gorm](https://gorm.io/))
  - `utils/`: utility methods
  - `view/`: API view models

### Sample usecases

   1. Create new API
      - Check out file `/pkg/routes/v1.go` and explore the code flow to see how to create and handle an API
      - Remember to annotate handler functions with [swaggo](https://github.com/swaggo/swag). Then run `make gen-swagger` to generate Swagger documentations

   2. New DB migration

      Check out `.sql` files under `/migrations` to write a valid schema migration / seed file

      - To apply new migration files, run `make migrate-up`
      - To apply seed files, run `make seed-db`
      - To apply new migration files for test DB, run `make migrate-test`

      **Note:** remember to run these 2 every time you pulling new code

      ```
      make migrate-up
      make migrate-test
      ```

   3. DB repositories

      Check out dirs under `/pkg/store`
