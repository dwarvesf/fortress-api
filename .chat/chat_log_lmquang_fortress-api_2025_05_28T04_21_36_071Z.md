**User:**
read @README.md , @docs to understand project overview, structure code , and current context. Then you need to analyze an issue in @invoice.go where CalculateCommissions use db directly in handler layer which is incorrect to compare with current data flow to process user's request. Please compose a plan to let me know how you would correct the issue

**User:**
please implement as we planned above

**Assistant:**
Okay, I've reviewed the `README.md` and the `docs` folder to understand the project structure and data flow.

The `README.md` clearly states:
- `pkg/handler/`: for handling API requests.
- `pkg/controller/`: (implicitly, as it's not explicitly defined but is a common pattern and present in the `invoice.go` imports) for business logic.
- `pkg/store/`: for data access layers, containing DB CRUD operations.

The current `CalculateCommissions` function in `pkg/handler/invoice/invoice.go` indeed directly uses `h.repo.DB()` for database operations:
- Fetching the invoice: `h.repo.DB().Where("id = ?", invoiceID).Preload(...).First(&invoice).Error`
- Beginning a transaction: `h.repo.DB().Begin()`
- Deleting existing commissions: `tx.Where("invoice_id = ? AND deleted_at IS NULL", invoiceID).Delete(&model.EmployeeCommission{}).Error`
- Deleting existing inbound fund transactions: `tx.Where("invoice_id = ? AND deleted_at IS NULL", invoiceID).Delete(&model.InboundFundTransaction{}).Error`
- Creating inbound fund transactions: `h.store.InboundFundTransaction.Create(tx, ...)` (This part uses the store, which is good, but it's within a transaction managed by the handler).
- Creating commission records: `tx.Create(&commission).Error`
- Committing or rolling back the transaction.

This direct database access in the handler bypasses the controller and store layers for several operations, which is inconsistent with the described architecture.

Here's my plan to correct the issue:

1.  **Refactor Database Operations to the Store Layer:**
    *   **Invoice Store (`pkg/store/invoice/invoice.go`):**
        *   Create a new method, potentially named `GetByIDForCommissionCalculation(db *gorm.DB, invoiceID string) (*model.Invoice, error)`, to fetch the invoice with all necessary preloads (`Project`, `Project.Heads`, `Project.BankAccount`, `Project.BankAccount.Currency`). This method will accept a `*gorm.DB` argument to be usable within a transaction.
    *   **EmployeeCommission Store (`pkg/store/employeecommission/employeecommission.go` if it exists, or add to `pkg/store/invoice/invoice.go` if more appropriate):**
        *   Create a method `DeleteByInvoiceID(db *gorm.DB, invoiceID string) error` to delete employee commissions.
    *   **InboundFundTransaction Store (`pkg/store/inboundfundtransaction/inboundfundtransaction.go`):**
        *   Ensure the existing `Create` method can accept a `*gorm.DB` for transactional operations.
        *   Create a method `DeleteByInvoiceID(db *gorm.DB, invoiceID string) error` to delete inbound fund transactions.
    *   **Commission Store (likely `pkg/store/employeecommission/employeecommission.go` or part of `pkg/store/invoice/invoice.go`):**
        *   Create a method `CreateBulk(db *gorm.DB, commissions []model.EmployeeCommission) error` or ensure the existing `Create` method can be called in a loop within a transaction managed by the controller.

2.  **Move Business Logic and Transaction Management to the Controller Layer (`pkg/controller/invoice/invoice.go`):**
    *   Modify the existing `CalculateCommissionFromInvoice` or create a new method like `ProcessCommissions(invoiceID string) ([]model.EmployeeCommission, error)`.
    *   This controller method will:
        *   Start a database transaction using `c.store.DB().Begin()`.
        *   Call the new store method to fetch the invoice.
        *   Perform the commission calculation logic (which seems to be already somewhat in `CalculateCommissionFromInvoice`, but ensure it uses the fetched invoice data).
        *   Call the store methods to delete existing `EmployeeCommission` and `InboundFundTransaction` records using the transaction.
        *   Iterate through calculated commissions:
            *   If it's an "Inbound Fund" commission, call the `InboundFundTransaction` store's `Create` method with the transaction.
        *   Filter out inbound fund commissions from the list to be saved as `EmployeeCommission`.
        *   Call the `EmployeeCommission` store's `Create` or `CreateBulk` method with the transaction to save the new commissions.
        *   Commit the transaction if all operations succeed, or rollback if any error occurs.
        *   Return the calculated commissions or an error.

3.  **Update the Handler Layer (`pkg/handler/invoice/invoice.go`):**
    *   The `CalculateCommissions` handler method will become much simpler.
    *   It will retrieve `invoiceID` and `dryRun` parameters.
    *   It will call the updated/new controller method (e.g., `c.controller.Invoice.ProcessCommissions(invoiceID)`).
    *   If `dryRun` is true:
        *   It will still need a way to get the calculated commissions without persisting. The controller method `CalculateCommissionFromInvoice` seems suitable for this. The main change will be that the *saving* part is handled by a different controller method or within a conditional block in a combined controller method.
        *   Perhaps `CalculateCommissionFromInvoice` remains as is for dry runs, and a new controller method, say `SaveCommissions(invoiceID string, commissions []model.EmployeeCommission) error`, is created to handle the database transaction and saving logic.
        *   Alternatively, the `ProcessCommissions` controller method could take a `dryRun bool` parameter.
    *   If `dryRun` is false:
        *   It calls the controller method that handles the transaction and saving.
    *   It will then return the JSON response based on the controller's output.

This plan ensures that:
-   Database queries and CUD (Create, Update, Delete) operations are encapsulated within the store layer.
-   Business logic, including transaction management and orchestration of store calls, resides in the controller layer.
-   The handler layer remains responsible only for request/response handling and calling the controller.

This aligns with the project's defined structure and promotes better separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

Would you like me to proceed with generating the code changes based on this plan?

**Assistant:**
**Summary of what was done:**

- All direct DB access in the `CalculateCommissions` handler was removed.
- All DB operations (fetch, delete, create, transaction) are now handled in the controller's new `ProcessCommissions` method.
- The store layer is used for all DB access, following the project architecture.
- The handler now simply calls the controller and returns the result.
- The necessary store and interface methods for deleting by invoice ID were added.
- The controller interface was updated to include the new method.

**You can now review, test, and merge these changes. If you want further improvements or tests, let me know!**

**Assistant:**
Okay, I can help you document our discussion based on the playbook rules.

A key part of the playbook seems to be capturing the conversation history. To do this, I need your GitHub username which is used to organize the logs.

Could you please provide your GitHub username so I can save our chat log according to the playbook?

Once I have that, I can also propose creating an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) to document the decision we made about moving the database logic out of the handler and into the controller and store layers, as this is a significant structural change based on the project's architectural patterns outlined in the README.
