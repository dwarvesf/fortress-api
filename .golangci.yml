    - errcheck # Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in go programs. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases
    - govet # Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string
    - ineffassign # Detects when assignments to existing variables are not used
    - staticcheck # It's the set of rules from staticcheck (includes gosimple in v2)
    - unused # Checks Go code for unused constants, variables, functions and types

  # customize
    # - execinquery # execinquery is deprecated since v1.58.0
    # - errorlint # errorlint is a linter for that can be used to find code that will cause problems with the error wrapping scheme introduced in Go 1.13.
    - bodyclose # checks whether HTTP response body is closed successfully
    - errname # Checks that sentinel errors are prefixed with the Err and error types are suffixed with the Error.
    - unconvert # Remove unnecessary type conversions
    - whitespace # Tool for detection of leading and trailing whitespace

    # - gofumpt # Gofumpt checks whether code was gofumpt-ed.
